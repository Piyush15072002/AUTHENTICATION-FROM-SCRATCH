# AUTHENTICATION-FROM-SCRATCH

### AUTHENTICATION WITHOUT DEPENDENCIES 	:lock_with_ink_pen: :key:

Here the auth is setup from scratch and Bcrypt is used to hash the password, then store the user data in the database.
The authorization is done by developing a middleware that checks if the session has user logged in info or not and then that middleware is passed to the routes to authorize.
